# Save the observation. If this option is set to a filename then
# the observation will be saved to disk as a GeoTiff.

# The models to run. Each model can be given various configuration options. The
# output can be an in-memory file by setting 'output: /vsimem/filename'. All
# other parameters are set on the model object as attributes.
#
# Models can be loaded from the 'models' directory in the current path
# (default), from a pickled file on disk (using joblib.dump) or from a pickled
# model in a public s3 bucket. The later cases, the name should be of the form:
#
#   file://path_to_file:sha256checksum
#
# or
#
#   s3://bucket/key:sha256checksum
#
# Checksums can be generated on the command line with:
#
#   % shasum -a 256 filename
# 
# Checksums are required for security purposes and also to ensure that you know
# which version of the model you are running. Retraining a machine learning model
# will change the checksum of the model.
